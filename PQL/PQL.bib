	doi = {10.1191/1471082X06st106oa},
	abstract = {Fitting multilevel models to discrete outcome data is problematic because the discrete distribution of the response variable implies an analytically intractable log-likelihood function. Among a number of approximate methods proposed, second-order penalised quasi-likelihood ({PQL}) is commonly used and is one of the most accurate. Unfortunately, even the second-order {PQL} approximation has been shown to produce estimates biased toward zero in certain circumstances. This bias can be marked especially when the data are sparse. One option to reduce this bias is to use Monte-Carlo simulation. A bootstrap bias correction method proposed by Kuk has been implemented in {MLwiN}. However, a similar technique based on the Robbins–Monro ({RM}) algorithm is potentially more efﬁcient. An alternative is to use simulated maximum likelihood ({SML}), either alone or to reﬁne estimates identiﬁed by other methods. In this article, we ﬁrst compare bias correction using the {RM} algorithm, Kuk’s method and {SML}. We ﬁnd that {SML} performs as efﬁciently as the other two methods and also yields standard errors of the bias-corrected parameter estimates and an estimate of the log-likelihood at the maximum, with which nested models can be compared. Secondly, using simulated and real data examples, we compare {SML}, second-order Laplace approximation (as implemented in {HLM}), Markov Chain Monte-Carlo ({MCMC}) (in {MLwiN}) and numerical integration using adaptive quadrature methods (in Stata’s {GLLAMM} and in {SAS}’s proc {NLMIXED}). We ﬁnd that when the data are sparse, the second-order Laplace approximation produces markedly lower parameter estimates, whereas the {MCMC} method produces estimates that are noticeably higher than those from the {SML} and quadrature methods. Although proc {NLMIXED} is much faster than {GLLAMM}, it is not designed to ﬁt models of more than two levels. {SML} produces parameter estimates and log-likelihoods very similar to those from quadrature methods. Further our {SML} approach extends to handle other link functions, discrete data distributions, non-normal random effects and higher-level models.},

	abstract = {[Mixed-effects models have become a popular approach for the analysis of grouped data that arise in many areas as diverse as clinical trials, epidemiology, and sociology. Examples of grouped data include longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. In the case of linear mixed-effects ({LME}) models, the likelihood function can be expressed in closed form, with efficient computational algorithms having been proposed for maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation. For nonlinear mixed-effects ({NLME}) models and generalized linear mixed models ({GLMMs}), however, the likelihood function does not have a closed form. Different likelihood approximations, with varying degrees of accuracy and computational complexity, have been proposed for these models. This article describes algorithms for one such approximation, the adaptive Gaussian quadrature ({AGQ}), for {GLMMs} which scale up efficiently to multilevel models with arbitrary number of levels. The proposed algorithms greatly reduce the computational complexity and the memory usage for approximating the multilevel {GLMM} likelihood, when compared to a direct application of a single-level {AGQ} approximation algorithm to the multilevel case. The accuracy of the associated estimates is evaluated and compared to that of estimates obtained from other approximations via simulation studies.]},

Nevertheless, the resulting approximations are generally as accurate and in some cases more accurate than approximations based on third-order expansions of the likelihood and requiring the evaluation of third derivatives.

Several different methods for estimating the parameters in nonlinear mixed-effects model have been proposed. We concentrate here on two of them--maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. A rather complex numerical issue for (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear mixed-effects models is the evaluation of the log-likelihood function of the data, because it involves the evaluation of a multiple integral that, in most cases, does not have a closed-form expression. We consider here four different approximations to the log-likelihood, comparing their computational and statistical properties. We conclude that the linear mixed-effects ({LME}) approximation suggested by Lindstrom and Bates, the Laplacian approximation, and Gaussian quadrature centered at the conditional modes of the random effects are quite accurate and computationally efficient. Gaussian quadrature centered at the expected value of the random effects is quite inaccurate for a smaller number of abscissas and computationally inefficient for a larger number of abscissas. Importance sampling is accurate, but quite inefficient computationally.]},

	abstract = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models ({GLMMs}) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial {GLMMs}, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients ({ICCs}) using Poisson and binomial {GLMMs}. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of {GLMMs}. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of {GLMMs}, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial {GLMMs} with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Using three real data sets from cancer screening intervention trials with different numbers and types of clusters and cluster sizes, we obtained point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals for the {ICC} using five methods: the analysis of variance estimator, the Fleiss-Cuzick estimator, the Pearson estimator, an estimator based on generalized estimating equations and an estimator from a random intercept logistic regression model. We compared estimates of the {ICC} for the overall sample and by study condition. Our results show that {ICC} estimates from different methods can be quite different, although confidence intervals generally overlap. The {ICC} varied substantially by study condition in two studies, suggesting that the common practice of assuming a common {ICC} across all clusters in the trial is questionable. A simulation study confirmed pitfalls of erroneously assuming a common {ICC}. Investigators should consider using sample size and analysis methods that allow the {ICC} to vary by study condition.},
